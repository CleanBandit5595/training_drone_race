## The Exercise In A Sentence

"Creating a quadcopter tracking another quadcopter in simulation at a given height above him". 

## Definition Of Done

1. 2 quadcopters running in simulation. 

2. One is the leader, and the other is the follower. The follower should follow the leader wherever he goes. 

3. Both should be viewed on Mission Planner. The leader should be able to move with the Mission Planner `go to`  interface. 

4. The follower height above the leader should be configurable.

5. Bonus (depending on time of the exercise - consult with your instructor): enable swapping in real-time between the follower and the leader.
